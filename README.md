# Processing-Multiple-Types-of-Value-and-Approaching-the-Goal
Reaching the closest value using different types of variables written in Java

This code written in Java contains a mini-project test that processes values of different types and tries to find the closest result to a target value by adding, subtracting and multiplying these values. The program processes various test scenarios using values of different types such as Integer, String and Month. In each test scenario, a set of values and a target value are determined, then certain mathematical or string operations are applied on these values to try to obtain the closest result.
